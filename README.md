# Project Description:

This e-sports API is a powerful backend system built on the rapid execution of Node.js, the query efficiency of GraphQL, and the robust data integrity ensured by TypeScript. Leveraging the advanced features of Apollo Server 4, it offers enhanced performance, better error handling, and greater flexibility in managing GraphQL operations. By integrating data from trusted sources like Pandascore and Wikipedia, it provides a reliable backbone for applications seeking e-sports data. This API is optimized for performance and ensures accurate, up-to-date information. With GraphQL's pinpoint querying, data delivery is streamlined, while TypeScript's strong typing guarantees data consistency. It's the ideal backend solution for platforms demanding swift, precise, and comprehensive e-sports data.


# Requirements to run it locally:

* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/)
* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download "NodeJS")
* [GraphQL](https://www.npmjs.com/package/graphql)
* [Typescript](https://www.npmjs.com/package/typescript-documentation)
* [ApolloServer 4](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/)

# Installation instructions:

## Install the dependencies from Node:

```sh
npm install
```

## Now you can run the development server in the port 3000🔓🔒🛠:

```sh
npm run dev
```

## To run production ready code 🚀🚀👩‍🚀👩‍🚀:

```sh
npm start
```

This will create a local server in your app on the port specified in the `index.ts` file:

```sh
http://localhost:3000/
```

# Tests:

Run the unit tests:

```sh
  npm test
```
